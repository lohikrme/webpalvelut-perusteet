To use router.js endpoints...

"add a new customer":
which works by sending POST request host/api/customers (data inside body)
one must insert the data of new customer correctly (excluding ID, which is generated from currentTimeMilliseconds)
For example, insert next JSON inside body, make sure data type is raw -> JSON:
{
        "firstName": "Peter",
        "lastName": "Griffin",
        "email": "peter.griffin@familyguy.com",
        "phone": "0451928327"
}

"modify a existing customer":
select PUT method, id is inside req.params.id, other data is inside body
in addition to raw -> JSON, select also headertype -> contentType -> application/json:
{
    "firstName": "Mary",
    "lastName": "Biden",
    "email": "mary.biden@gmail.com",
    "phone": "044932732"
}
